<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

Hi 👋, I'm Hojung (James), a fourth-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University, deeply interested in the transformative power of cloud technologies in software development and deployment. My experience includes a Software Developer in Test Internship at Atimi Software, where I contributed to enhancing system reliability, streamlining communication, and adapting to the fast-paced nature of agile development.

My technical strengths lies in python, docker, and Kubernetes. I excel in architecting and managing scalable cloud environments, leveraging my expertise in GCP to design resilient and cost-effective solutions. Whether it's optimizing cloud resources for efficiency, implementing robust CI/CD pipelines for seamless software delivery, or securing cloud architectures against evolving threats, I'm committed to driving digital transformation and operational excellence.

I'm on a mission to land a cloud based role, aiming to utilize my proficiency in cloud computing and automation to enhance operational efficiency.
