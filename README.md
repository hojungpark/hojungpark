<h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

Hi 👋, I'm Hojung (James), a fourth-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University, deeply interested in the transformative power of cloud technologies in software development and deployment. My passion for technology drives me to constantly explore and adapt to new advancements, preparing me for a pivotal transition from Software Development Testing to Cloud Engineering.

During my 8-month tenure as a Software Developer in Test, I developed a keen insight into automating testing processes, ensuring software reliability, and implementing best practices in quality assurance. These experiences have laid a solid foundation for my journey into cloud engineering by highlighting the importance of automation, continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD), and system reliability.

I'm currently seeking opportunities to expand my horizons in a cloud based role, where I can leverage my skills in cloud computing and automation to drive digital transformation and operational excellence.
